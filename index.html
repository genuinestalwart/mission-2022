                <h3>Develop Some <br>Discord Bots</h3>
                <p>The easiest way for me to start my network and earn money is, creating and selling discord bots.

                <h3>Build a Network <br>and a Community</h3>
                <p>I want to create an awesome organization. To do so, I need some resources and equipmnets, which can only be gained by creating a network at first. That's why my target is to launch it by August 2022 anyhow. I also have an idea of building a unique platform for coders, but I won't reveal its name now.</p>
