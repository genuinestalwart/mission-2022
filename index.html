                <h3>Develop Some <br>Discord Bots</h3>
                <p>The easiest way for me to start my network and earn money is, creating and selling discord bots. Since I know the basics of javascript and discord quite well, it won't be much difficult for me. In fact, I have already started working on my first bot, <strong>Rimonite</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Build a Network <br>and a Community</h3>
                <p>I want to create an awesome organization. To do so, I need some resources and equipmnets, which can only be gained by creating a network at first. That's why my target is to launch it by August 2022 anyhow. I also have an idea of building a unique platform for coders, but I won't reveal its name now.</p>

                    <p>There are already so many platforms to learn coding. But very few places exist where people can get proper information about <i>how to get started as a beginner</i>. So my idea is to create such a platform, where we will guide others to start learning and help them like a mentor.</p>
